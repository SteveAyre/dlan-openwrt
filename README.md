# dlan-openwrt

This is the devolo dLAN package feed for OpenWrt.
It contains the firmware and tools for the Powerline (PLC) interface of devolo dLAN pro devices.

## PLC firmware and pib files

PLC firmware and pib files are fetched and extracted from the official firmware during the build.

The resulting packages are for personal use only and should not be redistributed.

## Usage

This repository is intended to be layered on-top of an OpenWrt buildroot. If you do not have an OpenWrt buildroot installed, see the documentation at: [OpenWrt Buildroot â€“ Installation](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence) on the OpenWrt support site.

To add it to the buildroot add the following line to feeds.conf.default (or feeds.conf if it exists):
```
src-git dlan https://github.com/devolo/dlan-openwrt.git
```

To install all its package definitions, run:
```
./scripts/feeds update dlan
./scripts/feeds install -a -p dlan
```

Then follow the instructions in README.md inside the dlan-fw package of this repository.
